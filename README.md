# gologme

Ulogme is awesomesauce, but there are some not so great things. Namely
that I have to set it up on a bunch of computers and it requires multiple
tools running in the background and they don't always exit as cleanly as
they should. That and I can't compile logs in a single place. This is even
worse when considering android in the mix.

And mostly I want to practice go more :)

## Goals

- Feature parity with ulogme
- Android client

## TODO

- [ ] TLS for server-connection [https://github.com/valyala/gorpc](valyala/gorpc)
- [ ] standalone mode
- [ ] lockscreen detection
- [ ] cross platform logging
  - https://github.com/kavu/AyeAye/ maybe
  - PRs welcome since I don't have a mac.
