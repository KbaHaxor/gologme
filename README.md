# gologme

Ulogme is awesomesauce, but there are some not so great things. Namely
that I have to set it up on a bunch of computers and I can't compile logs
in a single place. This is even worse when considering android.

I want all of my devices going to one place, I want nice deliniation
of "work" and counters for "work time" ensure I hit 40/week.

And mostly I want to practice go more :)
